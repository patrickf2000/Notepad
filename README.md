## Notepad

Notepad is a very simple text editor/note-taking app for Android. It has most common features a user would expect, including taking new notes, deleting notes, and renaming notes. Additionally, there are a few nice features, including a previewer for html files, and a template manager (for saving and using templates).   

This app is licensed under BSD-3. I recently released it to Google Play; you can find it here:
