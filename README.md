## Notepad

Notepad is a very simple text editor/note-taking app for Android. It has most common features a user would expect, including taking new notes, deleting notes, and renaming notes. Additionally, there are a few nice features, including a previewer for html files, and a template manager (for saving and using templates).   

This app is licensed under BSD-3. Note that it is not in any app store at this point. If you wish to use it, you have to build and sideload it. In the future, ready-to-use APKs will be found on the releases page.
